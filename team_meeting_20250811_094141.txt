I'll simulate the team discussion:

Dr. Chen (Leading): "Thank you all for joining. We need to carefully dissect the APOE region while avoiding false positives from LD complications. Let me start with the reference panel issues I'm seeing..."

Dr. Chen: "Our current reference panel isn't capturing some rare variants well in this region. I suggest we create a custom reference panel combining 1000G with deep-sequencing data from AD cohorts. This should better represent the actual LD patterns around APOE."

Dr. Patel: "Building on that, the colocalization analyses are particularly tricky here. I'm seeing what look like independent QTL signals, but when I dig deeper, many appear to be E4 shadows. We need a hierarchical conditioning approach where we:
1. First condition on E4
2. Then look for additional signals using a more stringent p-value threshold
3. Verify each signal with cross-tissue consistency"

Dr. Wang: "The fine-mapping stability is my main concern. I've run sensitivity analyses showing that small changes in LD structure can dramatically affect the posterior probabilities in this region. I propose:
- Using multiple fine-mapping methods (SuSiE, FINEMAP, CAVIARBF)
- Implementing a cross-validation framework
- Setting more conservative credible set thresholds"

Dr. Torres: "From the biology side, we know APOE has complex regulation. Beyond E4, there are documented enhancer elements and potential regulatory variants. We should specifically look for:
- Enhancer variants from chromatin data
- Protein-altering variants in LD-neighbors like TOMM40
- Tissue-specific regulatory effects"

Dr. Rodriguez (Critical perspective): "I see several potential pitfalls:
1. We might be over-correcting for E4
2. Tissue-specific effects could be noise
3. The custom reference panel might introduce new biases
We need clear null models for each analysis step."
