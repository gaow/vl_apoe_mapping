# Enhanced colocalization task with more context

I have comprehensive molecular QTL data showing multiple colocalizations with my APOE GWAS signals:

DATASETS:
- Brain eQTL, pQTL, sQTL from multiple cohorts
- CSF pQTL data including trans effects
- Individual-level genotype/phenotype data for molecular traits
- ~300 candidate genes in chr19:44-46Mb region

RESULTS:
- 15+ molecular QTL signals with colocalization PP4 > 0.8
- Most are in high LD with APOE E2/E3/E4 variants
- Effect sizes seem inflated compared to other genomic regions
- Trans effects particularly strong for E4
- Cross-modality and tissue consistency is variable

CHALLENGES:
- Many may be false positives due to LD artifacts from dominant E4 effect
- Need to distinguish true biological signals from statistical echoes
- Want to identify new genes beyond APOE that variants regulate
- Scale: efficiently analyzing colocalizations across ~300 genes

QUESTIONS:
1. How do I distinguish true colocalization from LD echoes?
2. Should I condition molecular QTL data on E4 before colocalization?
3. What methods work best for multi-causal variant scenarios?
4. How do I validate molecular signals are E4-independent?
5. What's the most efficient workflow for ~300 candidate genes?

Please provide a robust analysis pipeline with specific software recommendations.
