TASK: 
SPECIFIC PROBLEM: When I condition my APOE GWAS analysis on E4 variants (rs429358), I get spurious independent signals because my LD reference panel doesn't perfectly match my study population. The E4 effect is so strong that even small LD mismatches create false positives.

QUESTIONS:
1. How can I diagnose whether my LD reference panel is accurate enough?
2. What alternative conditioning strategies work better for dominant signals?  
3. Should I try population-stratified analysis (E4 carriers vs non-carriers)?
4. How do I validate that "independent" signals aren't just LD artifacts?

Please provide specific methodological recommendations with software/parameter suggestions.


*Adjusts glasses thoughtfully*

Thank you for these excellent questions about APOE conditional analysis. This is indeed a challenging region where standard approaches often fail due to the extreme effect size of E4 combined with complex LD patterns.

Let me address each question systematically:

1. **Diagnosing LD Reference Panel Accuracy:**

First, we need multiple validation approaches:

a) Compare allele frequencies between your GWAS and reference panel:
- Calculate AFdiff = |AF_gwas - AF_ref| for all variants
- Flag variants with AFdiff > 0.05 for careful review
- Particularly examine E4 tagging variants

b) LD decay comparison:
```R
# Using LDpair in LDlinkR or similar
for (lead_snp in apoe_variants) {
  compare_r2_patterns(lead_snp, window=500kb,
                     population1=your_gwas,
                     population2=reference)
}
```

2. **Alternative Conditioning Strategies:**

For strong signals like APOE, I recommend:

a) Z-score based conditioning:
- Use GCTA-COJO with multiple reference panels
- Compare results across 1000G and population-specific panels
- Use more stringent thresholds (p < 1e-8) for declaring independence

b) Bayesian approach:
```bash
# Using FINEMAP
finemap --sss --n-causal-snps 3 --in-files chr19.z,chr19.ld
# Compare posterior probabilities with/without conditioning
```

c) Local genetic correlation:
- Use ρ-HESS to examine genetic correlation structure
- Look for truly independent blocks

3. **Population Stratification Analysis:**

This is valuable but tricky. I suggest:

a) Meta-analysis approach:
- Separate analysis in E4 carriers/non-carriers
- Use inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis
- Compare heterogeneity statistics

b) Interaction testing:
```R
# Using GENESIS or similar
interaction_test(genotype ~ E4_status + covariates + 
                genotype:E4_status)
```

4. **Validating Independent Signals:**

Critical validation steps:

a) Cross-reference multiple LD panels:
- 1000G
- UK Biobank (if available)
- Population-specific panels
- Flag signals that disappear with different panels

b) Haplotype analysis:
```bash
# Using SHAPEIT4
shapeit4 --input chr19.vcf --region APOE
# Examine haplotype structure around candidate independents
```

c) Sensitivity analysis:
- Vary conditioning SNP sets
- Use different window sizes
- Compare effect sizes pre/post conditioning

IMPORTANT CAVEATS:
1. Even with perfect LD reference, E4's effect size may cause numerical instability
2. Consider using robust regression methods
3. Be extremely skeptical of "independent" signals within 100kb of E4

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use multiple conditioning approaches and only trust signals replicated across methods
2. Implement stepwise validation pipeline
3. Consider functional annotation to support statistical evidence
4. Document all QC steps carefully

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss specific software parameters in more detail?
