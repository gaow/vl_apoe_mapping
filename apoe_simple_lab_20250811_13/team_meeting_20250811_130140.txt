I'll simulate the team discussion, with each specialist contributing based on their expertise:

Dr. Chen (Leading discussion): "Thank you all for joining. Let's address the APOE signal separation challenge systematically. I'll start with the LD reference panel concerns - we're seeing significant differences between panels that could create artificial signals."

Dr. Torres: "The APOE biology here is crucial. E4's effect is so dominant because it impacts multiple pathways. We should consider stratifying by E4 status before looking for independent signals. [SEARCH NEEDED: Latest APOE E4 stratification methods in GWAS]"

Dr. Wang: "Agreed. I suggest a three-stage fine-mapping approach:
1. Initial mapping with E4 included
2. E4-stratified analysis
3. Conditional analysis with robust LD estimation
The key is ensuring our fine-mapping remains stable across different reference panels."

Dr. Patel: "For colocalization, we need to handle the strong LD structure carefully. I propose:
- Using multiple reference panels to cross-validate
- Implementing distance-based LD blocks
- Running sensitivity analyses with different colocalization priors"

Dr. Rodriguez (critically): "I see several potential issues:
1. How do we distinguish true independent signals from LD shadows?
2. Are we certain about the E4 stratification boundaries?
3. What's our false positive control strategy?"

Dr. Cho: "I can implement a pipeline that:
- Automates cross-reference panel validation
- Performs systematic sensitivity analyses
- Generates diagnostic plots for signal independence"
