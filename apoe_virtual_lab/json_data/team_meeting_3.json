For the APOE region, I've found that:\n- Standard 1000G panels may not capture rare variants adequately\n- We should use population-specific panels when possible\n- I suggest incorporating TOPMed as our primary reference\n- We need to carefully assess conditioning artifacts by comparing results across different reference panels\n\nI'm seeing concerning population stratification effects even within European ancestry. We should implement:\n- PC-matching before/after E4 conditioning\n- Local ancestry analysis in this region\n- Sensitivity analyses with different ancestry compositions\"\n\nDr. Patel: \"Building on Sarah's points about reference panels, for colocalization:\n- We should run COLOC-SuSiE with multiple tissue pairs\n- Cross-reference with GTEx v8 brain tissues\n- Implement LD block sensitivity analysis\n- Consider running separate analyses for each ancestral group\n\nI've developed some new approaches for detecting LD artifacts that could help here.\"\n\nDr. Wang: \"Excellent points. For fine-mapping:\n- SuSiE with varying L (credible sets)\n- Incorporate functional priors from PolyFun\n- Compare results with and without conditioning\n- Test for model misspecification using residual QQ plots\n\nI can provide code for robust inference under different prior specifications.\"\n\nDr. Rodriguez: \"Some critical considerations:\n- We need null simulations to validate each step\n- Should establish clear QC thresholds\n- Need to document all filtering decisions\n- Consider alternative causal mechanisms\n\nI suggest creating a validation framework that tests each component separately.\"\n\nROUND 2:\n\n[Continuing in next part due to length...]",
