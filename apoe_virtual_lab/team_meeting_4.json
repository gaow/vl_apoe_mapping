  "response": "I'll simulate this scientific discussion focused on developing a robust APOE analysis pipeline.\n\nROUND 1:\n\nDr. Chen:\n\"Let me start with the LD reference panel considerations. I've analyzed several reference panels and found that:\n- 1000G EUR alone may be insufficient for APOE region complexity\n- We should consider using TOPMed or UK Biobank as reference\n- Population-specific panels show substantial LD differences around APOE\nRecommendation: We need to implement multiple reference panel validation and quantify uncertainty in LD estimates.\"\n\nDr. Patel:\n\"Building on Sarah's point about reference panels, for colocalization:\n- We should run COLOC-SuSiE with multiple tissue pairs\n- Important to account for LD differences between GWAS and eQTL datasets\n- Suggest implementing systematic cross-tissue validation pipeline\nQuestion: How do we handle potential E4 conditioning artifacts in colocalization?\"\n\nDr. Wang:\n\"Regarding fine-mapping approaches:\n- SuSiE with adaptive prior could help with APOE region complexity\n- PolyFun annotation-informed priors may improve resolution\n- Critical to assess robustness across different conditioning strategies\nSuggestion: We should compare results across multiple fine-mapping methods.\"\n\nDr. Rodriguez:\n\"Some critical considerations:\n- Need clear criteria for declaring independent signals\n- Important to establish false positive control procedures\n- Should develop simulation framework to validate methods\nConcern: How do we ensure reproducibility across different ancestries?\"\n\nROUND 2:\n\n[Continue with subsequent rounds and conclude with action items? Would you like me to proceed?]",
