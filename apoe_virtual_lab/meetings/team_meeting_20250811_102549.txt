VIRTUAL LAB TEAM MEETING
============================================================
Timestamp: 2025-08-11T10:25:49.556822
Participants: Dr. Sarah Chen, Dr. Raj Patel, Dr. Lisa Wang, Dr. Elena Rodriguez
Rounds: 3

AGENDA:
----------
Integrate methodological recommendations into unified APOE analysis pipeline

DISCUSSION:
----------
I'll simulate this scientific discussion round by round.

ROUND 1:

Dr. Chen: "Let me start with the LD reference panel considerations. For the APOE region, I've found that:
- Standard 1000G panels may not capture rare variants adequately
- We should use population-specific panels when possible
- I suggest incorporating TOPMed as our primary reference
- We need to carefully assess conditioning artifacts by comparing results across different reference panels

I'm seeing concerning population stratification effects even within European ancestry. We should implement:
- PC-matching before/after E4 conditioning
- Local ancestry analysis in this region
- Sensitivity analyses with different ancestry compositions"

Dr. Patel: "Building on Sarah's points about reference panels, for colocalization:
- We should run COLOC-SuSiE with multiple tissue pairs
- Cross-reference with GTEx v8 brain tissues
- Implement LD block sensitivity analysis
- Consider running separate analyses for each ancestral group

I've developed some new approaches for detecting LD artifacts that could help here."

Dr. Wang: "Excellent points. For fine-mapping:
- SuSiE with varying L (credible sets)
- Incorporate functional priors from PolyFun
- Compare results with and without conditioning
- Test for model misspecification using residual QQ plots

I can provide code for robust inference under different prior specifications."

Dr. Rodriguez: "Some critical considerations:
- We need null simulations to validate each step
- Should establish clear QC thresholds
- Need to document all filtering decisions
- Consider alternative causal mechanisms

I suggest creating a validation framework that tests each component separately."
