TASK: 
SPECIFIC PROBLEM: When I condition my APOE GWAS analysis on E4 variants (rs429358), I get spurious independent signals because my LD reference panel doesn't perfectly match my study population. The E4 effect is so strong that even small LD mismatches create false positives.

QUESTIONS:
1. How can I diagnose whether my LD reference panel is accurate enough?
2. What alternative conditioning strategies work better for dominant signals?  
3. Should I try population-stratified analysis (E4 carriers vs non-carriers)?
4. How do I validate that "independent" signals aren't just LD artifacts?

Please provide specific methodological recommendations with software/parameter suggestions.


*Adjusts glasses thoughtfully*

Thank you for this challenging APOE conditioning problem. The E4 variant's strong effect makes this particularly tricky, as even minor LD reference mismatches can cascade into false signals. Let me address each question systematically:

1. DIAGNOSING LD REFERENCE ACCURACY:

First, I recommend these specific checks:
- Compare allele frequencies between your study and reference panel using plink --freq
- Generate local LD matrices for both populations:
```
plink --r2 square --ld-window 500 --ld-window-kb 1000
```
- Calculate LD decay patterns specifically around rs429358
- Use LDstore2 to generate detailed LD statistics

Key metrics to examine:
- R² differences >0.1 between reference and study population
- Systematic bias in LD patterns
- Population-specific haplotype blocks

2. ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONING STRATEGIES:

I recommend a multi-pronged approach:

a) Hierarchical conditioning:
- First condition on broader haplotypes using GCTA-COJO
- Then condition on specific variants
```
gcta64 --cojo-file mydata --cojo-slct --cojo-p 5e-8
```

b) Regional conditioning:
- Use window-based conditioning (±500kb around APOE)
- Implement stepwise conditioning with decreasing p-value thresholds

c) Consider using FINEMAP for fine-mapping:
```
finemap --sss --in-files config.data
```

3. POPULATION-STRATIFIED ANALYSIS:

Yes, but with important caveats:
- Stratify by E4 carrier status
- Use principal components within each stratum
- Test for heterogeneity between strata
- Consider using METAL for meta-analysis between strata

Implementation:
```
plink --within e4strata.txt --pca 10
```
Then run separate GWAS for each stratum.

4. VALIDATING INDEPENDENT SIGNALS:

Critical validation steps:
1. Cross-reference with different LD panels:
- 1000G
- Population-specific panels
- Internal LD calculations

2. Haplotype analysis:
```
plink --hap-assoc
```

3. Sensitivity analysis:
- Vary conditioning window sizes
- Test different p-value thresholds
- Compare results across multiple reference panels

4. Functional validation:
- Check eQTL databases
- Examine chromatin state data
- Consider biological plausibility

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Use local LD calculation when possible:
```
plink --r2 --ld-window-kb 1000 --ld-snp rs429358
```

2. Implement robust SE estimation:
- Use sandwich estimators
- Bootstrap critical regions

3. Consider Bayesian approaches:
- FINEMAP with different prior configurations
- JAM for joint analysis

4. Quality control:
- Remove variants with significant Hardy-Weinberg deviation
- Check for genotyping batch effects
- Examine cluster plots for key variants

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific parameters for any of the tools mentioned?
