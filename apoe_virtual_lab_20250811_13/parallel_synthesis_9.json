PolyFun integration for functional priors\n- Critical to assess convergence and credible set calibration\nEstimated time: 4-5 weeks for comprehensive fine-mapping\"\n\nDr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology):\n\"Key biological considerations:\n- Must condition on classical E2/E3/E4 variants first\n- Prioritize genes with known AD pathways (APP processing, inflammation)\n- Consider tissue-specific effects in brain regions\n- Focus on regulatory variants in enhancer regions\nSuggested 2-month timeline for biological validation\"\n\nDr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic):\n\"Critical methodological concerns:\n- Risk of collider bias from E2/E3/E4 conditioning\n- Need for negative control regions\n- Importance of replication cohorts\n- Careful assessment of winner's curse\nRecommend 3-4 weeks for critical evaluation steps\"\n\nDr. Alex Cho (Implementation):\n\"Implementation framework:\n- Snakemake workflow for reproducibility\n- Containerized environments (Docker/Singularity)\n- GPU acceleration for fine-mapping\n- Automated QC reporting\nInitial setup: 3-4 weeks\"\n\n[Would you like me to proceed with Round 2 where participants refine and integrate these initial recommendations?]",

I recommend:\n- Using population-matched 1000 Genomes Phase 3 panels\n- Additional validation with gnomAD v3.1 for rare variants\n- Special attention to APOE E2/E3/E4 haplotype structures\n- Minimum 5,000 samples per ancestry group for stable LD estimation\nKey concern: Standard LD reference panels may not capture APOE haplotype structures accurately.\"\n\nDr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):\n\"Given the complex APOE region, I suggest:\n- Initial COLOC-SuSiE analysis for multiple signal detection\n- Follow-up with eCAVIAR for variants with r2 > 0.4\n- ColocBoost for validation of hits\nCritical: We need to account for known APOE effects in molecular QTL analysis.\"\n\nDr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):\n\"For this challenging region:\n- Start with SuSiE using 1000G LD\n- Cross-validate with FINEMAP (shotgun stochastic search)\n- Apply PolyFun for functional priors\n- Use credible set criteria of 90% posterior probability\nKey diagnostic: Check convergence across multiple runs.\"\n\n[Would you like me to continue with the remaining participants' Round 1 recommendations before moving to Round 2?]\n\n\n\n**Web Search Results for 'Latest version of COLOC-SuSiE and recommended parameters for complex regions':**\nSearch temporarily unavailable.\n",
