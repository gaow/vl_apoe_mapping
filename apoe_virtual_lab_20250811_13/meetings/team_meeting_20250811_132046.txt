VIRTUAL LAB TEAM MEETING: APOE Analysis Pipeline Development

**ROUND 1: Initial Recommendations**

Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel):
- Primary recommendation: Use population-matched 1000G reference panels with careful stratification
- Minimum 3 ancestry-specific reference panels (EUR, EAS, AFR) required
- Calculate LD matrices using PLINK v1.9 with r2 threshold >0.001
- Critical: Account for long-range LD patterns in APOE region
- Generate LD heat maps pre/post APOE conditioning to identify artifacts
- Validate LD patterns across multiple reference populations

Dr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):
- Implement multi-signal colocalization pipeline:
  1. COLOC-SuSiE for handling multiple causal variants
  2. eCAVIAR as secondary validation
  3. colocboost for increased sensitivity
- Set strict posterior probability thresholds (PP4 > 0.8)
- Account for different molecular QTL types (eQTL, sQTL, pQTL)
- Generate colocalization plots for visual inspection

Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):
- Three-tiered fine-mapping approach:
  1. SuSiE primary analysis (handle multiple causal variants)
  2. FINEMAP validation
  3. PolyFun for functional priors
- Credible set criteria: 95% posterior inclusion probability
- Implement cross-validation across methods
- Generate fine-mapping diagnostic plots

Dr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology):
- Prioritize analysis of known regulatory regions:
  - APOE enhancer cluster (chr19:45,449,000-45,452,000)
  - TOMM40/APOE promoter region
  - Known liver-specific regulatory elements
- Consider tissue-specific effects (brain, liver, microglia)
- Account for isoform-specific expression patterns

Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic):
- Key validation requirements:
  1. Replication in independent cohorts
  2. Cross-ancestry validation
  3. Biological plausibility checks
  4. Systematic bias assessment
- Documentation of all assumptions and limitations
- Negative control analyses using matched genomic regions

Dr. Alex Cho (Implementation):
- Develop modular Snakemake pipeline
- Implement parallel processing for 300 genes
- Automated QC reporting system
- Version control and documentation
- Resource estimation: 500 CPU hours total

**ROUND 2: Integration and Refinement**

Cross-cutting themes and dependencies:

1. LD Reference Integration (Chen + Wang):
- Generate ancestry-specific LD matrices
- Share matrices across fine-mapping methods
- Implement LD-aware gene prioritization

2. Fine-mapping/Colocalization Interface (Patel + Wang):
- Harmonize variant selection criteria
- Share posterior probabilities across methods
- Joint visualization framework

3. Biological Validation (Torres + Rodriguez):
- Tissue-specific expression validation
- Literature-based prioritization matrix
- Functional annotation integration

4. Implementation Framework (Cho + all):
- Modular pipeline structure:
  - LD calculation module
  - Fine-mapping module
  - Colocalization module
  - Visualization module
- Automated reporting system

**ROUND 3: Synthesis and Implementation**

Final Pipeline Structure:

1. Data Preparation (Week 1-2):
- QC of input data
- LD reference panel preparation
- Annotation compilation

2. Primary Analysis (Week 3-4):
- Parallel fine-mapping across genes

- Initial biological filtering

3. Validation (Week 5-6):
- Cross-method comparison
- Replication analysis
- Functional validation

4. Final Integration (Week 7-8):
- Results synthesis

Gene Prioritization Strategy:
1. Tier 1 (~30 genes):
- Known AD association
- Strong regulatory evidence
- High expression in relevant tissues

2. Tier 2 (~100 genes):
- Moderate biological evidence
- Tissue-specific expression
- Protein interaction networks

3. Tier 3 (~170 genes):
- Remaining candidates
- Exploratory analysis
