Rounds: 2

TASK:
----------
Develop multi-method fine-mapping approach robust to E4 dominance and model misspecification

CONTEXT:
----------
SuSiE identifies many high-PIP variants but unreliable; need validation strategies for strong confounder scenarios

RESPONSE:
----------
Thank you for the opportunity to refine my recommendations. Let me first verify some recent methodological developments.



**Web Search Results for 'latest fine-mapping methods strong confounding signals 2023 APOE':**
Search temporarily unavailable.


While awaiting search results, I'll enhance my previous approach with more specific robustness measures:

1. Refined Analysis Strategy:

a) Hierarchical Fine-mapping Pipeline:
```r
# Stage 1: Initial Signal Characterization
# Run methods with increasingly complex priors
methods_pipeline = list(
  "baseline" = list(
    susie_params = list(L=15, coverage=0.95),
    finemap_params = list(n_causal=10)
  ),
  "functional" = list(
    polyfun_params = list(
      annotations = c("CADD", "ENCODE", "GTEx"),
      min_prior = 1e-5
    )
  ),
  "conditional" = list(
    condition_vars = c("rs429358", "rs7412"),
    window_size = 1e6
  )
)
```

b) Robust Signal Detection:
```r
# Implement stability selection
stability_params = list(
  subsample_prop = 0.5,
  n_iterations = 100,
  threshold = 0.5,
  # Handle E4 dominance
  stratify_by_distance = list(
    distance_bins = c(0, 50000, 100000, 500000),
    min_signals_per_bin = 2
  )
)
```

2. Enhanced Validation Framework:

a) Cross-Method Concordance:
```r
validate_signals <- function(results_list) {
  # Calculate Jaccard similarity between credible sets
  credset_similarity <- pairwise_jaccard(results_list)
  
  # Assess PIP stability
  pip_stability <- calculate_pip_variance(
    method_results = results_list,
    bootstrap_iterations = 1000,
    exclude_top_signal = TRUE  # Remove E4 effect
  )
  
  # Test for LD block independence
  ld_independence <- test_block_independence(
    credible_sets = results_list$credible_sets,
    ld_matrix = ld_ref,
    r2_threshold = 0.05
  )
  
  return(list(
    similarity = credset_similarity,
    stability = pip_stability,
    independence = ld_independence
  ))
}
```

3. Specific Quality Control Steps:

a) LD Reference Validation:
```r
# Compare LD patterns across reference panels
ld_qc <- function(ref_panels) {
  for(panel in ref_panels) {
    # Calculate LD decay patterns
    ld_decay <- calculate_ld_decay(
      panel,
      distance_bins = seq(0, 1e6, by=1e4)
    )
    
    # Test for significant differences
    ld_differences <- compare_ld_patterns(
      panel1 = panel,
      panel2 = reference_panel,
      method = "KS.test"
    )
  }
}
```

4. E4 Dominance Mitigation:

a) Distance-based Prior Adjustment:
```r
calculate_adjusted_prior <- function(variant_info) {
  # Calculate distance from E4
  e4_distance <- abs(variant_info$pos - e4_position)
  
  # Adjust prior based on distance and functional annotations
  prior_weight <- sigmoid_decay(
    distance = e4_distance,
    scale = 100000,  # 100kb decay scale
    min_weight = 0.1
  ) * functional_score
  
  return(prior_weight)
}
```

5. Implementation Priority:

1. First pass: Core region (Â±250kb around APOE)
2. Expand: Full region analysis with validated parameters
3. Validate: Cross-reference with molecular QTL data

Key Metrics for Signal Validation:
- Credible set stability score (>0.8)
- Cross-method replication rate (>50%)
- LD block independence test (p < 0.01)
- Functional enrichment (>2-fold)

Would you like me to:
1. Search for specific recent publications on APOE fine-mapping?
2. Elaborate on any particular component?
3. Provide more detailed parameter recommendations?
