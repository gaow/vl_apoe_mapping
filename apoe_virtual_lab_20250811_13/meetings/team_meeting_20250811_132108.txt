VIRTUAL LAB TEAM MEETING: APOE Analysis Pipeline Development

**ROUND 1: Initial Recommendations**

Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel):
- Primary recommendation: Use population-matched 1000G reference panels with careful stratification
- Minimum 3 reference populations (EUR, EAS, AFR) for cross-population validation
- Generate local LD matrices using 5Mb window around APOE region
- Implement sliding window approach for LD calculation to capture long-range effects
- Quality metrics: R² threshold >0.8, minimum MAF >1% for reliable LD estimation

Dr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):
- Deploy COLOC-SuSiE for handling multiple causal variants
- Parallel implementation of eCAVIAR for cross-validation
- Prior probability parameters: p1=1e-4, p2=1e-4, p12=1e-5
- Colocalization threshold PP4>0.8 with sensitivity analysis
- Generate regional colocalization plots for visual inspection

Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):
- Primary: SuSiE with adaptive L parameter selection
- Secondary: FINEMAP for cross-validation
- PolyFun integration for functional priors
- Credible set threshold 95% coverage
- Independent signal threshold: r² < 0.1

Dr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology):
- Prioritize known regulatory elements: enhancers, promoters
- Focus on APOE-pathway genes (TOMM40, APOC1, CLU)
