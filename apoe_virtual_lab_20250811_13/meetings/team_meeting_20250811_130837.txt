VIRTUAL LAB TEAM MEETING
============================================================
Timestamp: 2025-08-11T13:08:37.126192
Participants: Dr. Sarah Chen, Dr. Raj Patel, Dr. Lisa Wang, Dr. Michael Torres, Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Dr. Alex Cho
Rounds: 3

AGENDA:
----------
Synthesize all expert recommendations into integrated, implementable APOE analysis pipeline with realistic prioritization for ~300 candidate genes (Parallel Session 1)

DISCUSSION:
----------
Let me help facilitate this virtual lab meeting to develop an integrated APOE analysis pipeline.

**ROUND 1: Initial Recommendations**

Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel):
"Given the complexity of the APOE region, I recommend:
- Using population-matched 1000G Phase 3 + TOPMed reference panels
- Careful QC filtering (MAF>1%, INFO>0.9, HWE p>1e-6)
- Computing local LD matrices in 1MB windows with 100kb overlap
- Implementing ancestry-specific analyses given APOE effect heterogeneity
Estimated time: 2-3 weeks for reference panel preparation"

Dr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):
"For multi-signal colocalization:
- Start with COLOC-SuSiE as primary method (handles multiple signals)
- Use eCAVIAR for validation of top signals
- Implement colocboost for signals with strong priors
- Set PP threshold >0.8 for primary calls
Estimated time: 3-4 weeks for full colocalization analysis"

Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):
"I propose a hierarchical fine-mapping approach:
1. Initial SuSiE run across full region
2. FINEMAP focused on high-priority sub-regions
3. PolyFun integration for functional priors
- Critical to assess convergence and credible set calibration
Estimated time: 4-5 weeks for comprehensive fine-mapping"

Dr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology):
"Key biological considerations:
- Must condition on classical E2/E3/E4 variants first
- Prioritize genes with known AD pathways (APP processing, inflammation)
- Consider tissue-specific effects in brain regions
- Focus on regulatory variants in enhancer regions
Suggested 2-month timeline for biological validation"

Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic):
"Critical methodological concerns:
- Risk of collider bias from E2/E3/E4 conditioning
- Need for negative control regions
- Importance of replication cohorts
- Careful assessment of winner's curse
Recommend 3-4 weeks for critical evaluation steps"

Dr. Alex Cho (Implementation):
"Implementation framework:
- Snakemake workflow for reproducibility
- Containerized environments (Docker/Singularity)
- GPU acceleration for fine-mapping
- Automated QC reporting
Initial setup: 3-4 weeks"

[Would you like me to proceed with Round 2 where participants refine and integrate these initial recommendations?]
