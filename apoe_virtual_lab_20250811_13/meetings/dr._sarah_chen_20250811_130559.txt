Rounds: 2

TASK:
----------
Develop comprehensive LD diagnostic framework and robust conditioning strategies for APOE region with ~300 candidate genes

CONTEXT:
----------
GWAS summary stats (~500k samples), multiple LD reference panels, need to handle E4 dominance and prioritize efficiently

RESPONSE:
----------
Thank you for the feedback. Let me refine my approach and verify some key methodological details.

While waiting for search results, let me outline a more focused and detailed framework:

1. Refined Analysis Approach:

a) Systematic LD Reference Panel Assessment:
- Primary focus on TOPMed (largest, most diverse) and population-matched subset
- Compute local LD structure using PLINK --r2 --ld-window-kb 2000 --ld-window 50000
- Generate LD scores specifically for chr19:44-46Mb region
- Create population-specific LD matrices using LDstore2 for computational efficiency

b) Enhanced Conditioning Strategy:
- Implement staged conditioning approach:
```
Stage 1: APOE main effects
- Condition on rs429358 (E4) and rs7412 (E2) using summary statistics
- Calculate residual z-scores using z' = z - rβ/se method

Stage 2: Local LD structure
- Define LD blocks using PLINK --blocks with modified parameters
- Calculate block-specific eigenvalues to assess independent signals
```

2. Specific Methodology Implementation:

a) LD Quality Control Pipeline:
```python
# Pseudocode for LD QC
for panel in [TOPMed, 1000G, UKB]:
    # Calculate LD metrics
    r2_matrix = compute_ld_matrix(panel, region="19:44-46Mb")
    
    # QC metrics
    ld_score = calculate_ld_score(r2_matrix)
    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eig(r2_matrix)[0]
    condition_number = max(eigenvalues)/min(eigenvalues)
    
    # Flag problematic regions
    if condition_number > 100:
        flag_region(start, end)
```

b) Robust Conditioning Framework:
- Implement GCTA-COJO with modified parameters:
```bash
gcta64 --bfile reference_panel \
       --cojo-file gwas_summary.txt \
       --cojo-slct \
       --cojo-p 5e-8 \
       --maf 0.01 \
       --cojo-wind 2000 \
       --out results
```

3. Validation Strategy:

a) Internal Validation:
- Compare results across different LD reference panels
- Implement leave-one-out analysis for each conditioning variant
- Calculate posterior probabilities for independent signals

b) External Validation:
- Cross-reference with molecular QTL data
- Check consistency with known APOE biology
- Validate in independent datasets if available

4. Quality Control Metrics:

a) LD-specific QC:
- R² distribution across reference panels
- Population-specific MAF comparisons
- LD block consistency measures

b) Signal Quality Metrics:
- Conditional independence scores
- Colocalization probability with molecular QTLs
- Effect size stability across conditioning steps

5. Prioritization Framework for 300 Genes:

a) Tier 1 (Highest Priority):
- Genes within 100kb of APOE
- Genes with known AD associations
- Genes with significant molecular QTLs

b) Tier 2:
- Genes in same LD block as APOE
- Genes with suggestive associations
- Genes with relevant biological function

Would you like me to:
1. Further detail any specific aspect of this framework?
2. Provide more specific parameters for any analysis step?
3. Elaborate on the gene prioritization strategy?

Please let me know what aspects need more development or clarification.
