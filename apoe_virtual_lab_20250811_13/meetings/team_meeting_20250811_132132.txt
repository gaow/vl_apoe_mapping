VIRTUAL LAB TEAM MEETING: APOE Analysis Pipeline Development

**ROUND 1: Initial Recommendations**

Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel):
- Primary recommendation: Use population-matched 1000G reference panels with careful stratification
- Minimum 3 ancestry-specific reference panels (EUR, EAS, AFR) for robust LD estimation
- Implement sliding window approach (250kb) with 50kb overlaps for APOE region
- Critical QC: Remove variants with MAF <1%, check reference allele matching
- Estimated time: 2 weeks for reference panel preparation and validation

Dr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):
- Implement hierarchical colocalization pipeline:
1. COLOC-SuSiE for initial signal decomposition
2. eCAVIAR for complex multi-SNP patterns
3. colocboost for validation of strongest signals
- Parameters: PP4 threshold >0.8, minimum regional PP >0.9
- Time estimate: 3-4 weeks for full pipeline implementation

Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):
- Three-tier fine-mapping approach:
1. SuSiE baseline analysis (L=10 maximum signals)
2. FINEMAP for validation (k=15 causal variants)
3. PolyFun for functional enrichment
- Critical: Implement stepwise conditioning on E2/E3/E4
- Diagnostic metrics: convergence checks, credible set coverage
- Timeline: 4-5 weeks for complete fine-mapping pipeline

Dr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology):
- Prioritization criteria:
1. Known APOE regulatory elements
2. Chromatin accessibility in relevant tissues
3. Conservation scores
- Focus on:
a) TOMM40-APOE intergenic region
b) APOE enhancer clusters
c) Nearby lipid metabolism genes
- Time estimate: 2-3 weeks for biological annotation

Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic):
- Critical evaluation points:
1. Population stratification effects
2. LD reference panel matching
3. Conditioning artifact detection
4. False positive control
- Validation requirements:
a) Permutation testing
b) Negative control regions
c) Cross-population replication
- Timeline: Ongoing throughout project

Dr. Alex Cho (Implementation):
- Technical infrastructure:
1. Snakemake workflow for pipeline automation
2. R/Python hybrid implementation
3. AWS batch computing integration
- Resource requirements:
a) 64-core compute instance
b) 256GB RAM minimum
c) 2TB storage
- Implementation time: 6-8 weeks

**ROUND 2: Integration and Refinement**

Cross-cutting themes and dependencies:

1. LD Reference Integration (Chen + Wang):
- Implement ancestry-specific fine-mapping
- Share LD matrices across methods
- Joint QC pipeline for reference matching

2. Colocalization-Fine-mapping Interface (Patel + Wang):
- Harmonize prior specifications
- Share credible sets between methods
- Unified conditioning strategy

3. Biological Prioritization (Torres + Rodriguez):
- Weight statistical evidence by biological relevance
- Develop quantitative prioritization score
- Incorporate tissue-specific effects

4. Implementation Framework (Cho + All):
- Modular pipeline design
- Standardized input/output formats
- Automated QC reporting

**ROUND 3: Synthesis and Implementation**

Final Pipeline Structure:

1. Data Preparation (Week 1-2):
- Reference panel preparation (Chen)
- GWAS/QTL data harmonization (Cho)
- Initial QC metrics (Rodriguez)

2. Primary Analysis (Week 3-6):
- Parallel fine-mapping streams (Wang)
- Colocalization analysis (Patel)
- Biological annotation (Torres)

3. Integration Phase (Week 7-8):
- Result aggregation (Cho)
- Quality assessment (Rodriguez)
- Biological interpretation (Torres)

4. Validation Phase (Week 9-10):
- Cross-method validation (All)
- Sensitivity analyses (Rodriguez)
- Documentation (Cho)

Gene Prioritization Strategy:
1. Tier 1 (~50 genes):
- Direct APOE pathway involvement
- Strong statistical evidence
- Known AD relevance

2. Tier 2 (~100 genes):
- Secondary pathway connections
- Moderate statistical evidence
- Tissue-specific expression

3. Tier 3 (~150 genes):
- Remaining regional genes
- Weak/unclear evidence
- Novel candidates
