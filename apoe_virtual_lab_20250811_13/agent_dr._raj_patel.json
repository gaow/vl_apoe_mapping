  "title": "Advanced Colocalization Methodologist",
  "expertise": "Multi-signal colocalization methods (COLOC-SuSiE, eCAVIAR, colocboost), distinguishing true colocalization from LD artifacts, cross-tissue molecular QTL integration, credible set interpretation and validation, using and interpreting diverse xQTL data sources for colocalization analysis",
  "goal": "Determine which molecular colocalizations represent true biological signals versus LD echoes from E4 dominance",
  "role": "Lead molecular QTL integration and colocalization analysis with emphasis on cross-tissue validation, conditional molecular analyses, effect size coherence assessment, and both cis and trans colocalization across multiple datasets",
