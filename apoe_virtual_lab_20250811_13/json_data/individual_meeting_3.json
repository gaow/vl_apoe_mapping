    "As Dr. Lisa Wang, I'll outline a comprehensive fine-mapping strategy for the APOE region that addresses the E4 dominance challenge.\n\n1. Analysis Approach:\n\n\n\n**Web Search Results for 'latest fine-mapping methods for strong confounding signals 2023':**\nSearch temporarily unavailable.\n\n\nBased on current best practices, I recommend a multi-layered approach:\n\na) Primary Analysis:\n- Run parallel fine-mapping using multiple methods:\n  * SuSiE with varying prior configurations\n  * FINEMAP with different maximum causal variant settings (k=5,10,15)\n  * PolyFun+SuSiE for functionally-informed priors\n  * JAM for Bayesian model averaging\n\nb) Conditioning Strategy:\n- Implement stepwise conditioning on known APOE variants:\n  1. Full unconditional analysis\n  2. Condition on E4 (rs429358)\n  3. Condition on both E4 and E2 (rs7412)\n  4. Compare credible sets across conditioning scenarios\n\n2. Detailed Methodology:\n\na) Data Preparation:\n```\n- Generate matched LD reference panels:\n  * Use 1000G EUR + molecular QTL samples\n  * Calculate local LD blocks using PLINK --blocks\n  * Compare LD patterns between references\n```\n\nb) Fine-mapping Pipeline:\n```r\n# SuSiE Implementation\nsusie_fit <- susie(\n  z_scores = gwas_z,\n  R = LD_matrix,\n  L = 15,  # Maximum signals\n  coverage = 0.95,\n  min_abs_corr = 0.1,\n  estimate_prior_variance = TRUE\n)\n\n# FINEMAP parallel run\nfinemap_config <- list(\n  n_causal = c(5,10,15),\n  prior_std = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4),\n  regions = sliding_windows(window_size=2Mb, step=500kb)\n)\n```\n\n3. Validation Steps:\n\na) Credible Set Stability:\n- Cross-validation across methods\n- Jackknife resampling of LD reference\n- Sensitivity analysis to prior specifications\n\nb) Colocalization Validation:\n```r\n# For each putative signal\nfor(signal in credible_sets) {\n  # Run coloc with molecular QTLs\n  coloc_results <- run_coloc(\n    gwas_data = gwas_stats,\n    qtl_data = molecular_qtls,\n    region = signal$region,\n    p1 = 1e-4,  # Prior probability of GWAS hit\n    p2 = 1e-4,  # Prior probability of QTL\n    p12 = 1e-5  # Prior probability of shared signal\n  )\n}\n```\n\n4. Limitations & Solutions:\n\na) E4 Dominance:\n- Implement hierarchical priors that account for distance from E4\n- Use functional annotations to upweight independent regulatory regions\n\nb) LD Reference Mismatch:\n- Generate bootstrap confidence intervals for LD estimates\n- Compare results across multiple reference panels\n\n5. Next Steps:\n\na) Implementation Pipeline:\n1. Set up computational pipeline for parallel method execution\n2. Establish QC metrics for signal reliability\n3. Create visualization framework for cross-method comparison\n\nb) Validation Framework:\n```python\n# Pseudo-code for validation pipeline\ndef validate_signals(credible_sets):\n    # Method consistency check\n    consistency_score = check_method_overlap(credible_sets)\n    \n    # LD stability analysis\n    ld_stability = assess_ld_robustness(credible_sets)\n    \n    # Functional enrichment\n    enrichment = test_functional_enrichment(credible_sets)\n    \n    return ValidationReport(consistency_score, ld_stability, enrichment)\n```\n\nI recommend starting with a pilot analysis on a subset of the region to optimize parameters before scaling to the full 300-gene region.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these components or search for specific methodological details?",
    "Thank you for the opportunity to refine my recommendations. Let me first verify some recent methodological developments.\n\n\n\n**Web Search Results for 'latest fine-mapping methods strong confounding signals 2023 APOE':**\nSearch temporarily unavailable.\n\n\nWhile awaiting search results, I'll enhance my previous approach with more specific robustness measures:\n\n1. Refined Analysis Strategy:\n\na) Hierarchical Fine-mapping Pipeline:\n```r\n# Stage 1: Initial Signal Characterization\n# Run methods with increasingly complex priors\nmethods_pipeline = list(\n  \"baseline\" = list(\n    susie_params = list(L=15, coverage=0.95),\n    finemap_params = list(n_causal=10)\n  ),\n  \"functional\" = list(\n    polyfun_params = list(\n      annotations = c(\"CADD\", \"ENCODE\", \"GTEx\"),\n      min_prior = 1e-5\n    )\n  ),\n  \"conditional\" = list(\n    condition_vars = c(\"rs429358\", \"rs7412\"),\n    window_size = 1e6\n  )\n)\n```\n\nb) Robust Signal Detection:\n```r\n# Implement stability selection\nstability_params = list(\n  subsample_prop = 0.5,\n  n_iterations = 100,\n  threshold = 0.5,\n  # Handle E4 dominance\n  stratify_by_distance = list(\n    distance_bins = c(0, 50000, 100000, 500000),\n    min_signals_per_bin = 2\n  )\n)\n```\n\n2. Enhanced Validation Framework:\n\na) Cross-Method Concordance:\n```r\nvalidate_signals <- function(results_list) {\n  # Calculate Jaccard similarity between credible sets\n  credset_similarity <- pairwise_jaccard(results_list)\n  \n  # Assess PIP stability\n  pip_stability <- calculate_pip_variance(\n    method_results = results_list,\n    bootstrap_iterations = 1000,\n    exclude_top_signal = TRUE  # Remove E4 effect\n  )\n  \n  # Test for LD block independence\n  ld_independence <- test_block_independence(\n    credible_sets = results_list$credible_sets,\n    ld_matrix = ld_ref,\n    r2_threshold = 0.05\n  )\n  \n  return(list(\n    similarity = credset_similarity,\n    stability = pip_stability,\n    independence = ld_independence\n  ))\n}\n```\n\n3. Specific Quality Control Steps:\n\na) LD Reference Validation:\n```r\n# Compare LD patterns across reference panels\nld_qc <- function(ref_panels) {\n  for(panel in ref_panels) {\n    # Calculate LD decay patterns\n    ld_decay <- calculate_ld_decay(\n      panel,\n      distance_bins = seq(0, 1e6, by=1e4)\n    )\n    \n    # Test for significant differences\n    ld_differences <- compare_ld_patterns(\n      panel1 = panel,\n      panel2 = reference_panel,\n      method = \"KS.test\"\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. E4 Dominance Mitigation:\n\na) Distance-based Prior Adjustment:\n```r\ncalculate_adjusted_prior <- function(variant_info) {\n  # Calculate distance from E4\n  e4_distance <- abs(variant_info$pos - e4_position)\n  \n  # Adjust prior based on distance and functional annotations\n  prior_weight <- sigmoid_decay(\n    distance = e4_distance,\n    scale = 100000,  # 100kb decay scale\n    min_weight = 0.1\n  ) * functional_score\n  \n  return(prior_weight)\n}\n```\n\n5. Implementation Priority:\n\n1. First pass: Core region (\u00b1250kb around APOE)\n2. Expand: Full region analysis with validated parameters\n3. Validate: Cross-reference with molecular QTL data\n\nKey Metrics for Signal Validation:\n- Credible set stability score (>0.8)\n- Cross-method replication rate (>50%)\n- LD block independence test (p < 0.01)\n- Functional enrichment (>2-fold)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.
