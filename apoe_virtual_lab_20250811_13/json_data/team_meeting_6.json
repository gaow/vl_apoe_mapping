  "response": "Let me help facilitate this virtual lab meeting to develop an integrated APOE analysis pipeline.\n\n**ROUND 1: Initial Recommendations**\n\nDr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel):\n\"Given the complexity of the APOE region, I recommend:\n- Using population-matched 1000G Phase 3 + TOPMed reference panels\n- Careful QC filtering (MAF>1%, INFO>0.9, HWE p>1e-6)\n- Computing local LD matrices in 1MB windows with 100kb overlap\n- Implementing ancestry-specific analyses given APOE effect heterogeneity\nEstimated time: 2-3 weeks for reference panel preparation\"\n\nDr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):\n\"For multi-signal colocalization:\n- Start with COLOC-SuSiE as primary method (handles multiple signals)\n- Use eCAVIAR for validation of top signals\n- Implement colocboost for signals with strong priors\n- Set PP threshold >0.8 for primary calls\nEstimated time: 3-4 weeks for full colocalization analysis\"\n\nDr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):\n\"I propose a hierarchical fine-mapping approach:\n1. Initial SuSiE run across full region\n2. FINEMAP focused on high-priority sub-regions\n3. PolyFun integration for functional priors\n- Critical to assess convergence and credible set calibration\nEstimated time: 4-5 weeks for comprehensive fine-mapping\"\n\nDr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology):\n\"Key biological considerations:\n- Must condition on classical E2/E3/E4 variants first\n- Prioritize genes with known AD pathways (APP processing, inflammation)\n- Consider tissue-specific effects in brain regions\n- Focus on regulatory variants in enhancer regions\nSuggested 2-month timeline for biological validation\"\n\nDr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic):\n\"Critical methodological concerns:\n- Risk of collider bias from E2/E3/E4 conditioning\n- Need for negative control regions\n- Importance of replication cohorts\n- Careful assessment of winner's curse\nRecommend 3-4 weeks for critical evaluation steps\"\n\nDr. Alex Cho (Implementation):\n\"Implementation framework:\n- Snakemake workflow for reproducibility\n- Containerized environments (Docker/Singularity)\n- GPU acceleration for fine-mapping\n- Automated QC reporting\nInitial setup: 3-4 weeks\"\n\n[Would you like me to proceed with Round 2 where participants refine and integrate these initial recommendations?]",
