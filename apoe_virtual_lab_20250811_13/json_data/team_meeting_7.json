Let's start with Round 1.\n\n**ROUND 1: Initial Recommendations**\n\nDr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel):\n\"For the APOE region, we need extremely careful LD reference panel selection. I recommend:\n- Using population-matched 1000 Genomes Phase 3 panels\n- Additional validation with gnomAD v3.1 for rare variants\n- Special attention to APOE E2/E3/E4 haplotype structures\n- Minimum 5,000 samples per ancestry group for stable LD estimation\nKey concern: Standard LD reference panels may not capture APOE haplotype structures accurately.\"\n\nDr. Raj Patel (Colocalization):\n\"Given the complex APOE region, I suggest:\n- Initial COLOC-SuSiE analysis for multiple signal detection\n- Follow-up with eCAVIAR for variants with r2 > 0.4\n- ColocBoost for validation of hits\nCritical: We need to account for known APOE effects in molecular QTL analysis.\"\n\nDr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping):\n\"For this challenging region:\n- Start with SuSiE using 1000G LD\n- Cross-validate with FINEMAP (shotgun stochastic search)\n- Apply PolyFun for functional priors\n- Use credible set criteria of 90% posterior probability\nKey diagnostic: Check convergence across multiple runs.\"\n\n[Would you like me to continue with the remaining participants' Round 1 recommendations before moving to Round 2?]\n\n\n\n**Web Search Results for 'Latest version of COLOC-SuSiE and recommended parameters for complex regions':**\nSearch temporarily unavailable.\n",
