TASK: 
I have eQTL, pQTL, and sQTL data showing multiple colocalizations with my APOE GWAS signals. 
However, I suspect many are false positives due to LD artifacts from the dominant E4 effect.

My results show:
- 15+ molecular QTL signals with colocalization PP4 > 0.8
- Most are in high LD with APOE E4 variants  
- Effect sizes seem inflated compared to other regions

How do I distinguish true colocalization from LD echoes?


*Adjusts glasses thoughtfully*

Thank you for bringing this challenging problem to me. The APOE region is indeed notorious for producing LD-driven false positive colocalizations. Let me outline a systematic approach to filter true signals from LD artifacts.

1. Multi-Signal Colocalization Analysis:
First, I strongly recommend switching from standard COLOC to COLOC-SuSiE or eCAVIAR, as these methods can handle multiple causal variants. In my experience with APOE:

```R
# Recommended analysis pipeline
- Run COLOC-SuSiE with expanded window (Â±500kb)
- Compare signal clusters across QTL types
- Evaluate residual associations after conditioning
```

2. Effect Size Coherence Testing:
We need to examine effect size patterns:
- Plot standardized effects (beta/SE) across molecular traits
- True colocalizations should show consistent directional effects
- Compare effect sizes to other validated molecular QTLs in similar tissues

3. Cross-Tissue Validation Strategy:
```
For each candidate colocalization:
- Check replication in independent tissue datasets
- Compare effect directions across tissues
- Evaluate tissue-specificity patterns
```

4. Conditional Analysis Framework:
Critical for APOE region:
```
a) Condition on E4 tag variants
b) Stepwise conditioning on top independent signals
c) Compare conditional vs unconditional colocalization
d) Flag signals that disappear after E4 conditioning
```

5. Molecular Evidence Integration:
For promising signals:
- Check protein-protein interaction networks
- Examine chromatin interaction data (Hi-C, ChIA-PET)
- Review pathway enrichment patterns

6. Red Flags for LD Artifacts:
- Uniform effect sizes across diverse molecular traits
- Loss of signal after E4 conditioning
- Lack of tissue-specificity pattern
- Biologically implausible effect directions

Specific Recommendations:

1. For your 15+ signals:
```
a) Run COLOC-SuSiE with following parameters:
   - prior.n = 3 
   - min.r2 = 0.01
   - window.cM = 0.1
   
b) Compare PP4 patterns pre/post E4 conditioning
```

2. Prioritize signals that:
- Maintain significance after conditioning
- Show tissue-specific effects
- Have supporting molecular evidence
- Demonstrate consistent effect patterns

3. Consider analyzing subgroup data:
- E4 carriers vs non-carriers
- Age-stratified analysis
- Tissue-specific effects

I've seen many APOE colocalizations dissolve under careful conditional analysis. I recommend being especially skeptical of signals that:
- Show uniform effects across all molecular traits
- Lack tissue specificity
- Cannot be validated in independent datasets

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or discuss specific signals in more detail?
