# APOE Virtual Lab - Manual Agent Framework

## 🏗️ Virtual Lab Setup 

### Your Research Question

**"Find independent Alzheimer's disease genetic predisposing variants in the APOE region independent of E2/E3/E4. The key is to addressing methodological challenges of strong E2/E3/E4 effects which makes variants in LD with these variants also very strongly associated with AD which is false positives, and to resolve the variants we need to use LD reference panels because we don't have indinvidual level data and LD panel mismatches is very common but in this case of strong signal it will be very serious issue in creating false positives"**

## 📋 Meeting Structure

### Phase 1: Project Specification Meeting

**Start a new Claude conversation with this prompt:**

```
VIRTUAL LAB TEAM MEETING

PARTICIPANTS:
- Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Reference Panel Specialist)  
- Dr. Raj Patel (Advanced Colocalization Methodologist)
- Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping Robustness Expert)
- Dr. Michael Torres (APOE Biology Specialist)
- Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic)

AGENDA: Project planning for APOE independent signals analysis

BACKGROUND:
- Analyzing APOE region (chr19:44-46Mb) for Alzheimer's disease
- Have GWAS summary statistics and fine-mapped molecular QTL data
- No individual level GWAS data but have individual level molecular QTL data input the genotypes and phenotypes
- MAJOR CHALLENGES:
  1. APOE E2/E3/E4 signal too strong, especially E4 - overshadows other signals when conditioning
  2. LD reference panel mismatches create spurious independent signals  
  3. Multiple xQTL colocalizations may be LD artifacts from E4 dominance but can also be signals
  4. xQTL can be not just for APOE but also other nearby genes. With individual level data xQTL it is relatively robust to detect molecular effects but it is uncertain if they have downstreams contributions to GWAS signals.

DISCUSSION POINTS:
1. What are the key methodological challenges we need to address?
2. What analysis strategies should we prioritize, particuarly integrating GWAS summary statistics, LD reference and a range of xQTL data from cis-eQTL, sQTL, pQTL to trans xQTL and more?
3. How do we validate any independent signals we find?
4. What are the most likely failure modes and how do we avoid them?

Please simulate a productive scientific discussion where each participant contributes their expertise. End with specific task assignments for each specialist.

### Phase 2: Individual Agent Consultations

After the team meeting, consult each agent individually:

#### Consultation 1: Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Specialist)
**New conversation with Dr. Chen's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Diagnose and solve the LD reference panel conditioning problem

SPECIFIC PROBLEM: 
When I condition my APOE GWAS analysis on E4 variants (rs429358), I get spurious independent signals because my LD reference panel doesn't perfectly match my study population. The E4 effect is so strong that even small LD mismatches create false positives. I cannot stratify by E4 becus we don't have idividual level data

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. How can I diagnose whether my LD reference panel is accurate enough?
2. What alternative conditioning strategies work better for dominant signals?
4. How do I validate that "independent" signals aren't just LD artifacts?

AVAILABLE RESOURCES:
- GWAS summary statistics (n~500k)
- Multiple LD reference panels (1000G, UKB, TOPMed)
- Individual-level genotype data for subset of the reference cohort but does not match with GWAS

Please provide specific methodological recommendations with software/parameter suggestions.
```

#### Consultation 2: Dr. Raj Patel (Colocalization Expert)  
**New conversation with Dr. Patel's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Resolve molecular QTL colocalization artifacts

SPECIFIC PROBLEM:
I have eQTL, pQTL, and sQTL data showing multiple colocalizations with my APOE GWAS signals. I also have trans pQTL showing colocalization in CSF with E4 very strongly. However, I suspect many are false positives due to LD artifacts from the dominant E4 effect creating spurious molecular associations. 

MY COLOCALIZATION RESULTS:
- 15+ molecular QTL signals showing colocalization (PP4 > 0.8)
- Most are in high LD with APOE E4 variants
- Effect sizes seem inflated compared to other regions especially for trans, but that is also consistent with literature which only focuses on trans E4 effecs and ignore other variants from which we want to find additional independent signal from.
- Cross-modality and cell and tissue consistency is variable

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. How do I distinguish true colocalization from LD echoes?
2. Should I condition molecular QTL data on E4 before colocalization?
3. What methods work best for multi-causal variant scenarios?
4. How do I validate molecular signals are E4-independent?

Please suggest a robust analysis pipeline for this challenging scenario.
```

#### Consultation 3: Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping Expert)
**New conversation with Dr. Wang's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION  

TASK: Robust fine-mapping despite E4 dominance

SPECIFIC PROBLEM:
Standard fine-mapping (SuSiE, FINEMAP) fails in APOE region because the E4 effect is so strong it overwhelms the statistical models. We observed lots of credible sets detected in that region when using the external LD reference. I need approaches that can identify independent signals despite this dominant confounder.

MY CURRENT RESULTS:
- SuSiE identifies lots of variants from AD GWAS but not even including E4.
- I have not tried different methods yet and not sure if it is worth trying because all methods suffer from the same intrincit issues. 
- Posterior probabilities can be very high PIP = 1 for so many variants and unreliable due to model misspecification

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. Which fine-mapping methods are most robust to strong confounders?
2. Should I exclude E4 variants entirely and re-run analysis?
3. How do I validate credible sets when standard approaches fail?
4. What diagnostics indicate fine-mapping model failure?

Please suggest a multi-method approach for robust inference.
```

#### Consultation 4: Dr. Michael Torres (Biology Expert)
**New conversation with Dr. Torres's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Biological prioritization of candidate independent variants

CONTEXT:
After addressing methodological issues, I may identify candidate independent variants beyond E2/E3/E4. I need to evaluate their biological plausibility and prioritize for validation. Especially from the xQTL prospective. For new independent GWAS sigansl I want to find new genes that they regulate not just APOE.

One challenge is that there are so many genes around APOE if we analyze all of them it's too many like 300 but if we focus on only nearby APOE we might be missing information.

CANDIDATE SCENARIOS:
1. Regulatory variants affecting molecular trait  levels of APOE
2. Variants in nearby genes (TOMM40, APOC1, PVRL2)   beyond APOE 
3. Long-range regulatory elements affecting the APOE cluster
4. Variants affecting APOE protein function beyond E2/E3/E4

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What are known regulatory mechanisms for APOE beyond E2/E3/E4?
2. Which genes in 19q13 have APOE-independent AD effects?
3. What functional validation approaches are most informative?
4. How do I prioritize variants for experimental follow-up?

Please provide biological context and validation strategies.
```

#### Consultation 5: Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic)
**New conversation with Dr. Rodriguez's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Critical evaluation of independent signals evidence

SCENARIO:
After methodological improvements, suppose I identify 2-3 candidate independent variants beyond E2/E3/E4. Before publication, I need rigorous critical evaluation.

One challenge is that there are so many genes around APOE if we analyze all of them it's too many like 300 but if we focus on only nearby APOE we might be missing information.


PRELIMINARY FINDINGS:
- Variants survive multiple conditioning approaches
- Show consistent molecular QTL effects across tissues  
- Have plausible biological mechanisms
- Replicate in independent GWAS datasets

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What are the most likely alternative explanations for these findings?
2. What additional negative controls should I include?
3. How strong does evidence need to be to overcome "extraordinary claims"?
4. What validation experiments are absolutely required?

Please provide skeptical but constructive criticism and validation requirements.
