# APOE Virtual Lab - Manual Agent Framework

## üèóÔ∏è Virtual Lab Setup 

### Your Research Question

**Find independent Alzheimer's disease genetic predisposing variants in the APOE region beyond E2/E3/E4 variants. Address methodological challenges from strong E2/E3/E4 effects that create false positive associations through linkage disequilibrium (LD) artifacts. Since we lack individual-level GWAS data and must rely on LD reference panels, mismatches become critical issues that generate spurious independent signals, particularly problematic given the dominant E4 effect.**

```



### Phase 2: Individual Agent Consultations

After the team meeting, consult each agent individually:

#### Consultation 1: Dr. Sarah Chen (LD Specialist)
**New conversation with Dr. Chen's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Diagnose and solve the LD reference panel conditioning problem

SPECIFIC PROBLEM: 
When I condition my APOE GWAS analysis on E2/E3/E4 variants (especially rs429358), I get spurious independent signals because my LD reference panel doesn't perfectly match my study population. The E4 effect is so strong that even small LD mismatches create false positives. I cannot stratify by E4 because we don't have individual-level GWAS data.

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. How can I diagnose whether my LD reference panel is accurate enough?
2. What alternative conditioning strategies work better for dominant signals?
3. How do I validate that "independent" signals aren't just LD artifacts?
4. What's the most efficient approach for ~300 candidate genes?

AVAILABLE RESOURCES:
- GWAS summary statistics (~500k samples)
- Multiple LD reference panels (1000G, UKB, TOPMed)
- Individual-level genotype data for subset of reference cohort (doesn't match GWAS population)

Please provide specific methodological recommendations with software/parameter suggestions.
```

#### Consultation 2: Dr. Raj Patel (Colocalization Expert)  
**New conversation with Dr. Patel's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Resolve molecular QTL colocalization artifacts

SPECIFIC PROBLEM:
I have eQTL, pQTL, and sQTL data showing multiple colocalizations with my APOE GWAS signals. I also have trans pQTL showing colocalization in CSF with E4 very strongly. However, I suspect many are false positives due to LD artifacts from the dominant E4 effect creating spurious molecular associations. 

MY COLOCALIZATION RESULTS:
- 15+ molecular QTL signals showing colocalization (PP4 > 0.8)
- Most are in high LD with APOE E4 variants
- Effect sizes seem inflated compared to other regions especially for trans, but that is also consistent with literature which only focuses on trans E4 effecs and ignore other variants from which we want to find additional independent signal from.
- Cross-modality and cell and tissue consistency is variable

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. How do I distinguish true colocalization from LD echoes?
2. Should I condition molecular QTL data on E4 before colocalization?
3. What methods work best for multi-causal variant scenarios?
4. How do I validate molecular signals are E4-independent?

Please suggest a robust analysis pipeline for this challenging scenario.
```

#### Consultation 3: Dr. Lisa Wang (Fine-mapping Expert)
**New conversation with Dr. Wang's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION  

TASK: Robust fine-mapping despite E4 dominance

SPECIFIC PROBLEM:
Standard fine-mapping (SuSiE, FINEMAP) fails in APOE region because the E4 effect is so strong it overwhelms the statistical models. We observed lots of credible sets detected in that region when using the external LD reference. I need approaches that can identify independent signals despite this dominant confounder.

MY CURRENT RESULTS:
- SuSiE identifies lots of variants from AD GWAS but not even including E4.
- I have not tried different methods yet and not sure if it is worth trying because all methods suffer from the same intrincit issues. 
- Posterior probabilities can be very high PIP = 1 for so many variants and unreliable due to model misspecification

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. Which fine-mapping methods are most robust to strong confounders?
2. Should I exclude E4 variants entirely and re-run analysis?
3. How do I validate credible sets when standard approaches fail?
4. What diagnostics indicate fine-mapping model failure?

Please suggest a multi-method approach for robust inference.
```

#### Consultation 4: Dr. Michael Torres (Biology Expert)
**New conversation with Dr. Torres's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Biological prioritization of candidate independent variants

CONTEXT:
After addressing methodological issues, I may identify candidate independent variants beyond E2/E3/E4. I need to evaluate their biological plausibility and prioritize for validation. Especially from the xQTL prospective. For new independent GWAS sigansl I want to find new genes that they regulate not just APOE.

One challenge is that there are so many genes around APOE if we analyze all of them it's too many like 300 but if we focus on only nearby APOE we might be missing information.

CANDIDATE SCENARIOS:
1. Regulatory variants affecting molecular trait  levels of APOE
2. Variants in nearby genes (TOMM40, APOC1, PVRL2)   beyond APOE 
3. Long-range regulatory elements affecting the APOE cluster
4. Variants affecting APOE protein function beyond E2/E3/E4

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What are known regulatory mechanisms for APOE beyond E2/E3/E4?
2. Which genes in 19q13 have APOE-independent AD effects?
3. What functional validation approaches are most informative?
4. How do I prioritize variants for experimental follow-up?

Please provide biological context and validation strategies.
```

#### Consultation 5: Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Scientific Critic)
**New conversation with Dr. Rodriguez's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Critical evaluation of independent signals evidence

SCENARIO:
After methodological improvements, suppose I identify 2-3 candidate independent variants beyond E2/E3/E4. Before publication, I need rigorous critical evaluation.

One challenge is that there are so many genes around APOE if we analyze all of them it's too many like 300 but if we focus on only nearby APOE we might be missing information.


PRELIMINARY FINDINGS:
- Variants survive multiple conditioning approaches
- Show consistent molecular QTL effects across tissues  
- Have plausible biological mechanisms
- Replicate in independent GWAS datasets

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What are the most likely alternative explanations for these findings?
2. What additional negative controls should I include?
3. How strong does evidence need to be to overcome "extraordinary claims"?
4. What validation experiments are absolutely required?

Please provide skeptical but constructive criticism and validation requirements.
```

#### Consultation 6: Dr. Alex Cho (Bioinformatics Engineer)
**New conversation with Dr. Cho's prompt + this task:**

```
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION

TASK: Design comprehensive computational workflow for APOE analysis pipeline integration

CONTEXT:
Based on methodological recommendations from LD, colocalization, fine-mapping, and biology experts, I need to implement a robust, scalable computational workflow.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. LD diagnostic and conditioning pipeline (Dr. Chen's recommendations)
2. Multi-signal colocalization workflow (Dr. Patel's methods)
3. Robust fine-mapping implementation (Dr. Wang's approaches)
4. Biological prioritization framework (Dr. Torres's criteria)
5. Quality control and validation procedures throughout
6. Efficient processing for ~300 candidate genes

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

2. Which specific software packages and versions should I use?
3. How do I ensure reproducibility and modularity?
4. What are the computational efficiency considerations?
5. How do I implement quality control at each step?
6. What's the best approach for handling the scale (~300 genes)?

Please provide detailed implementation plan with code structure, software recommendations, and workflow diagrams.
```

### Phase 3: Integration Meeting 

**Enhanced Integration Meeting with All Six Specialists:**

**New conversation with all six agents for synthesis:**

```
VIRTUAL LAB INTEGRATION MEETING

PARTICIPANTS: All six specialists

AGENDA: Synthesize all recommendations into integrated, implementable analysis pipeline with realistic prioritization for ~300 candidate genes

CONTEXT: Each specialist has provided recommendations for their area:
- Dr. Chen: LD diagnostic and conditioning strategies
- Dr. Patel: Robust colocalization approaches  
- Dr. Wang: Multi-method fine-mapping pipeline
- Dr. Torres: Biological prioritization framework
- Dr. Rodriguez: Critical evaluation standards
- Dr. Cho: Computational implementation workflow

MEETING STRUCTURE (3 Rounds):
**Round 1:** Initial integration of methodological approaches
**Round 2:** Refinement based on implementation constraints and scalability
**Round 3:** Final synthesis with concrete timeline and deliverables

INTEGRATION TASKS:
1. Synthesize methodological recommendations into coherent analysis plan
2. Identify dependencies between different approaches
3. Address computational and scalability challenges for ~300 genes
4. Establish evidence standards for claiming independent signals
5. Design validation experiments and replication strategy
6. Create realistic implementation timeline and resource requirements

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
- Can we definitively distinguish independent signals from LD artifacts?
- What combination of evidence constitutes sufficient proof?
- How do we efficiently prioritize among ~300 candidate genes?
- What's the most realistic and effective computational approach?
- How do we handle negative results (no true independent signals)?

Please simulate a productive 3-round synthesis discussion leading to implementable final recommendations.
```

**Note on Scalability:** The integration meeting should critically address the challenge of analyzing ~300 candidate genes. Experts should be realistic about resource constraints and suggest effective prioritization strategies rather than attempting comprehensive analysis of all genes simultaneously. Focus on the most promising candidates while maintaining methodological rigor.
